I removed my old nav bar and implemeneted one using bootstrap. I also changed the
formatting of the text to use bootstrap as well. 

Bootstrap has a dropdown menu which I used so the user can navigate to any specific
homework from all webpages, instead of having to go to the index every time.

I used bootstrap to round the img of whiskey, but I didn't want to edit it too much 
because I still wanted it to be hovereable.

I linked the older website via the homework index too.

My email in the contact section still doesnt do anthything, but I used bootstrap
button to display it instead of displaying it as a ul link.
