      Hello, my name is Allan Z McCombs. I am 22 years old. I am a CS student and I am currently in my senior year of college.
      I like to play video games and drink with my friends. My favorite alcohol is Jameson, and my favorite drink is Old Fashioned usually with Maker's
      or Wild Turkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left is a menu bar that will navigate to the homeworks and my contact info. Also, hover over the drink!
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not exactly sure what else I should put on the page. I first made the background color light blue because I like that color.
      After that, I wanted to add a cloud. Fortunate enough, css has the ability to place a picture behind text so that's cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the future, I would like to add a border type thing along the left side of the page for the navigation menu.
      I think I will then move my Old Fashioned picture to float right, but until then I will keep it where it is.
      I also would like to add some interactives to my homepage, like maybe a bee that buzzes around and if you click it, you can score points.
      It would have no actual importance or impact on my homepage, but I think that would be kinda cute and cool. Or maybe a hidden easter egg that
      takes you to a hidden page for fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe I will add a picture of me? I will have to take one though, I don't think I have any appropriate pictures for my homepage currently.
    </p>
    <ul id="EasterEgg">
      <li><a href="EasterEgg.html">Easter Egg!</a></li>
    </ul>
