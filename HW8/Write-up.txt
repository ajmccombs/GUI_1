Help from former student about infastructure ideas; went with psuedo-object orientated approach.
Other help is in-line documentations

Working:

Pictures:
- correctly shows the holder, boardLine, and the tiles

Drag and drop tiles.
- to the board line
- back to the holder

Submit and reset button.
- holds highscore after submit is intentional
- resert clears board line and gives holder new tiles
- sumbit only gives the amount of tiles equal to the amount used

Random tile generation for the holder.
- correct tile distribution
- correctly gives a new hand on reset

Score calculation:
- score is calculated correctly when on the bonus tiles
- two words are allowed with blank space
