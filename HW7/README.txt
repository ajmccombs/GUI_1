I used a homework extension token on this homework.

Created tab. Tab uses html injection just like previous homeworks, similiar to how
I created the Multiplication Table. Each tab has an X to remove it. Max allowed tabs
at once is 10. Will not save over 10, but I wasn't sure how to notify the user
because pop-ups are not a good way.

Slider was straight forward. Using the documentation and examples from cited sorces (in code)
was enough to get it working.
