Hw2 Part 2

Ran the html through the validator for html5. Got same error complaining about quirky heading:
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">

I'm going to ignore the warnings for "Article lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 ..." because
its just complaining about how I put <article> below a header.
